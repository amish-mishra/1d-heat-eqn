# Method
Using the [finite-difference method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method), we are able to numerically solve the heat equation. 

# This project
In this project, we focus on the 1 dimensional heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The Python file has a few initial conditions written in that the user can comment/uncomment to experiment with. At the end, the file generates an interactive plot to watch the solution evolve as time passes.
